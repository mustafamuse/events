## ‚ö°Ô∏è Events: Post Endpoint

Needed Url: https://eventsapp101.herokuapp.com/

# ‚ö°Ô∏è Must needs for a Post Request
name and event_type are the required key/value pairs

Event type should be one of the following:
```
[submit refer click read login logout share signup subcribe]

```


# ‚ö°Ô∏è Optional/addiotional params for a Post Request

One can include more key/value pairs and those will be considered "additional_data" and according to the requirments of this project, if no additional data exists, the object will be empty.

# ‚ö°Ô∏è Example Post Request with 'additional data'

```
{"event" : {"name" : "subscribe_button", "event_type" : "subscribe", "button_type" : "primary", "button_color" : "blue"  }
```
return a JSON Object that looks like this:

```
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "subscribe_button",
    "event_type": "subscribe",
    "additional_data": {
        "button_type" : "primary",
        "button_color" : "blue"
    }
}
```

That's all you need to know to start! üéâ

### Testing the Post Request
```
curl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{"event" : {"name" : "subscribe_button", "event_type" : "subscribe","button_color" : "blue" }}' 'https://eventsapp101.herokuapp.com/'

```

# ‚ö°Ô∏è Ive also included a few tests.

You can run this command:

```
rails test test/models/event_test.rb

```

### Testing the Todays stats (extra credit)

This endpoint takes all the events received today, groups them
by event_type and returns the count for each. The response are in JSON

for example

```
{"todays_stats" :
    [
        {"click" : 34},
        {"view": 54}
    ]
}
